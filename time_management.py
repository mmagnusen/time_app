# Welcome message, something like "Hi Marilyn! Well done on keeping up-to-date with your schedule. Let's help keep you on track :)"

# If I haven't entered one of these values for this particular day, there will be a prompt to ask me: how long at gym, how long at work, how long coding, how long socialising

# I should be able to enter a command which tells the app I've finished entering my hours for today

# It should give me a summary of each thing I've done today
